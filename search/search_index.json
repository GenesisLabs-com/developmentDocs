Color-keys Color-Keys package provides following functionalities to developers. * Generate new Wallet (pubkey,privkey,address). * Generate wallet from seed. * Sign message with wallet private key. Color-keys package was initially forked from cosmos-keys npm package. Now to generate color address instead of cosmos we had to change wallet address prefix. So, to change that: * Go to source folder * Open cosmos-keys.ts file * Move to line 61 and change the address prefix to desired prefix i.e color * Now change the name and version of the package from package.json file. * Publish the updated package to npm packages, using --access public tag. 2. Color-Legder This package helps interfacing with Color Ledger App. This package was also forked from cosmos ledger package. Following changes are made in it to make it run smoothly with color platform and color ledger app. * Navigate to cosmos-ledger.ts in the src folder. * On line #2 import color-keys package instead of cosmos-keys package. * Now on line #23 change the address prefix from cosmos to color . * On line # 107 there is a check on the ledger app name, change it to color .
